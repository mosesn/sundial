# TODO

## nice api things
1. builder-ish stuff (is this interoperable with what I have now?  will it require crazy implicits?
2. validation on demand
3. next should return the same type of the thing

## boring but important
1. more tests

## super boring but important
1. publish

## things that Pattern.scala suggested
1. make periodic things easy
2. specify starting time separately
