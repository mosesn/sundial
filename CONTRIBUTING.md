# Guidelines for contributing to Sundial.

Please create a pull request against `master`.

Try to make the code in the pull request as focused and clean as possible.  See
 [effective scala](http://twitter.github.com/effectivescala/), or the
[scala style guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/).  If the pull request is
too large, we may ask you to split it into smaller ones.

## Note
This CONTRIBUTING was stolen from the twitter/zipkin project, with small changes.
